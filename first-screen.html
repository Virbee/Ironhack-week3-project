      <h2>November 24th, 1982</h2>
      <p>The communist country of Arstotzka has ended a 6-year war with neighboring Kolechia and reclaimed its rightful half of the border town, Grestin.
          Among the throngs of immigrants, visitors and people looking for work are hidden smugglers, spies and terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>Yesterday an indicator informed you that a kolechian terrorist would try to pass the border. You have to demask him/her before he/she commits an attack. Someone who wants to stay anonymous saw him/her in person ; you can ask him 3 questions. No more.</p>
